<ins>**Overview**</ins>
The Electric Vehicle Analysis report is an interactive visualization created using Power BI. It provides insights into various aspects of electric vehicles (EVs) based on comprehensive data. Users can explore trends, compare different EV types, and understand key factors influencing EV adoption.

**Key Features**
Types of Electric Vehicles: The report categorizes EVs into segments such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

**Model Year Analysis:** Users can analyze how EV adoption has evolved over different model years. Are newer models gaining popularity? How has technology improved?

**Fuel Types:** Explore the impact of fuel types (electricity, gasoline, or a combination) on EV performance and efficiency.

**State-wise Insights:** Understand regional variations in EV adoption. Which states lead in EV sales? Are there policy differences affecting adoption rates?

**Electric Utility Analysis:** Dive into data related to charging infrastructure. Which utilities support EV charging? How accessible is charging infrastructure?

**Electric Range:** Visualize the electric range of different EV models. How far can they travel on a single charge?
